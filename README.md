this is a comprehensive collection of my coursework for the algorithms and data structures part of the c# course under tutelage of Marc Zaku. 

a note on the tic tac toe game:
due to the limited scope of possible states present in a tic tac toe game (somewhere around 3^9, or around 20 thousand), the implemented minimax algorithm simulates every path and board state and picks the best one available.
in a more complex game, such as chess, it would require a heuristic as it can only check so many steps ahead due to chess having more total permutations than there are atoms in the observable universe.
